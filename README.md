# Master Projects Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of my master's degree projects spanning various domains in data science, machine learning, and database systems.
## Projects Overview
1. Comprehensive Analysis of Big Data Technologies
An in-depth exploration of Hadoop ecosystem components including HDFS, YARN, and MapReduce, examining their roles in effective data management and analytics for enterprise applications. The project analyzes how these technologies address the challenges of volume, velocity, variety, and veracity in big data environments.
2. Object Detection on Pascal Dataset using EfficientNetB0
Implementation of a computer vision model using the EfficientNetB0 architecture to detect and classify objects in the Pascal VOC dataset. The model demonstrates the power of transfer learning in image classification tasks and achieves high accuracy on the test set.
3. Neural Network Architecture Design through VGG16
A specialized deep learning implementation using VGG16 architecture for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The model demonstrates how pre-trained architectures can be adapted for critical healthcare applications with high precision and recall metrics.
4. Comparison of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms
A comparative analysis of various supervised machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors) for music genre classification, evaluating their performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
5. Comprehensive Database Design and Management
Design and implementation of a healthcare management system database, incorporating proper normalization, entity-relationship modeling, and SQL implementation. The project includes a discussion of the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed database systems.
